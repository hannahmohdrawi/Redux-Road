# Redux Road
The creation of an adventure game using Redux's core concepts.

## Description
This code was created as part of Codecademy's Full Stack Engineer Path Module 22 Redux.
In this project, your objective is to create a text-based adventure game using reducers, state, and actions. The state will serve as a reflection of the game’s current status, encompassing elements such as the player’s inventory, distance covered, and time spent on the journey. Each occurrence within the game will be depicted as an action, allowing players to collect supplies, embark on travels, and occasionally, if they dare, encounter mishaps like overturning their wagon and losing their provisions.
